CAT/CDP kernel tree hosts patches for the CAT and CDP features that will be pushed to upstream.

The purpose of the tree is for the community to test the features. The latest CAT patches are in branch CAT16.1.
The latest CDP patches are in branch CAT15.CDP2.5. The patches in these two branches are based on cgroup,
but that approach has not been accepted by the Linux community, so the patches in these two branches are for users
to experiment with the feature. And the two branches are based on kernel version 4.6-rc1. 
Please see l3_cat_test_cases.txt in root directory for some simple test cases.
