Please execute "run_tests.sh" as root

./run_tests WIDHT DEPTH NUM_OF_TASKS_PER_FILE (E.g: ./run_tests 2 2 1)

This creates a directory structure which has width of 2 and depth of 2. i.e. the paths are sai/1/1/, sai/1/2/, sai/2/1/, sai/2/2/
and as each level in hierarchy has "tasks" file asscoiated, NUM_OF_TASKS_PER_FILE lets you decide on number of tasks this file can have.

Please make sure that total number of tasks are less than 10000 (to make sure that your system does not run out of memory).
This number can be calculated as [(width)^depth + (width)^(depth-1) + .... + (width)^0] * NUM_OF_TASKS_PER_FILE

There are some bugs and some optimizations that should be done, and I will work on that.
Known bug: ./run_tests 1 1 1

So, please execute this with 2<=WIDTH<=5 and 2<=DEPTH<=5 and 1<=NUM_OF_TASKS_PER_FILE<=10
